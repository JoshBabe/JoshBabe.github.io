    <h1>Numeric Surds Topic Summary (17/1/19) Joshua Bae</h1>
    <p>I had a few difficulties in the start where I simplified the square root but forgot there was a coefficient on the unsimplified square root.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>For e.g, the given question was 5âˆš12. </li>
        <li>I simplified it but left the multiplication of the co-efficients.</li>
        <li>In realisation, I knew I forgot it as the answer of the example video was way different to mine.</li>
    </ol>
