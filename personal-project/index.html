    <h2>Maths Worksheet (8/1/19)</h2>
    <p>Question 8 had an easy shortcut. To easily solve the question, you had to fill in the pronumeral, x, with an
        example. I filled it with a 5 to make the value of the grapes 10, making it become 2Kg, That was an example
        that enabled me to find out the solution to the question step by step.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>For grapes, 2x will be assumed as 10, leaving pronumeral,x, as 5 for an example</li>
        <li>In context of the rate $5/Kg, the solution to the example is 2kg.</li>
        <li>That enabled me to understand what the method was to the question. </li>
        <li>For grapes, the method was 2x/5 and for peaches, the method was x/7.</li>
        <li>I changed the denominator to 35 which allowed me to find out 19x/35=10kg which makes it 19x=350
        <li>Therefore, x is 18.42, making the amount of grapes 7.368kg and the amount of peaches</li>
        </li>
    </ol>
